# Noise Generator Circuit

Noise. It's everywhere and is inevitable, but it comes essential sometimes specifically and is fun to play with randomness. I tried to use a 2 transistor noise generator circuit which infact induces noise in one transistor with an open collector and the other one amplifies it to provide the noisy output.

The output is random and peaks are over around 0 to 30kHz(in the spectrum waterfall chart).
