#Stepper Motor Controller using PYNQ-Z2(with tuneable speed)

The [28BYJ-48](https://components101.com/motors/28byj-48-stepper-motor) unipolar motor has 5 wires one being Vcc from centre-tap of both the coils and others are A/A1 and B/B1 ends of each coil respectively.

Applications:
* Robotic control systems
* To implement precise and fast motor speed tuning
* Implementing multiple stepper controllers on a single FPGA
